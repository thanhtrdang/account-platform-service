    1. MainApplicationIntegrationTests: Test all end-points with full Spring context app.
    If you need create new *IntegrationTests and put some endpoints in that => consider new microservice first.

    2. *Specs: Unit tests, don't need start Spring Boot, and use Spectrum Mockito AssetJ..
    Sample *Specs only => PingServiceImplSpecs
